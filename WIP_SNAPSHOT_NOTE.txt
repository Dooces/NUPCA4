NUPCA3 axiom-faithfulness progress snapshot (WIP)

Label: STEP_PIPELINE_INCOMPLETE

This archive is intentionally a semantic-progress snapshot.
Primary goal: accurate instantiation of axioms; compile/run is secondary.

Known incomplete / not yet stabilized:
- nupca3/step_pipeline.py is not yet the finalized axiom-timed control loop.
  Expect missing/placeholder wiring for lag discipline (A5/A10/A14),
  structural logs (A12), and full end-to-end update ordering.

This snapshot includes:
- Axiom list / header clarifications merged into the tree.
- Intermediate refactors in control/budget, fovea, rollout, macrostate,
  and other modules as of this snapshot point.

DO NOT treat this snapshot as a frozen interface; it is a checkpoint.
