The “simple, holistic” fix that is actually implied by biology

You already have fast local prediction (cortex-like) and structural consolidation (sleep-like). What was missing is the brain’s always-on “scene gist + coverage” stack that sits above momentary gaze.

Fix 1 — Make coverage multi-scale (space and representation)

You validated coverage at the DoF/block level. The next obvious extension is: apply the same principle to representation strata, so you don’t only “look everywhere,” you also periodically refresh/test abstractions that won’t be locally surprising in the current fixation.

Concretely, maintain coverage debt at three granularities:

Block debt (already validated):

𝜏
block
(
𝑏
)
←
{
0
	
𝑏
=
fovea
(
𝑡
)


𝜏
block
(
𝑏
)
+
1
	
otherwise
τ
block
	​

(b)←{
0
τ
block
	​

(b)+1
	​

b=fovea(t)
otherwise
	​


Expert debt (memory coverage):

𝜏
𝑗
←
{
0
	
𝑗
∈
𝐴
𝑡


𝜏
𝑗
+
1
	
otherwise
τ
j
	​

←{
0
τ
j
	​

+1
	​

j∈A
t
	​

otherwise
	​


Band/level debt (abstraction coverage): tag each node by a crude “level” (e.g., by 
∣
𝑜
𝑢
𝑡
𝑗
∣
∣out
j
	​

∣ or spatial scale: 
1
×
1
,
2
×
2
,
3
×
3
,
…
1×1,2×2,3×3,…), and track 
𝜏
band
(
ℓ
)
τ
band
	​

(ℓ) similarly.

Then:

Fovea selection (policy-level, not macrostate):

score
(
𝑏
)
=
residual
(
𝑏
)
⏟
fast surprise
+
𝜆
cov
log
⁡
(
1
+
𝜏
block
(
𝑏
)
)
score(b)=
fast surprise
residual(b)
	​

	​

+λ
cov
	​

log(1+τ
block
	​

(b))

This is exactly the mechanism your sims show is necessary.

Active-set selection (within your existing A5/A7 substrate): augment node score with debt without changing macrostates:

𝑢
𝑗
←
𝑢
𝑗
+
𝛼
cov,exp
log
⁡
(
1
+
𝜏
𝑗
)
+
𝛼
cov,band
log
⁡
(
1
+
𝜏
band
(
ℓ
𝑗
)
)
u
j
	​

←u
j
	​

+α
cov,exp
	​

log(1+τ
j
	​

)+α
cov,band
	​

log(1+τ
band
	​

(ℓ
j
	​

))

This is the “what to remember at what level” part: it prevents the system from permanently starving higher-level (rarely directly surprising) structure.

Fix 2 — Add “peripheral gist” as a cue source, not as per-expert input

What biology does that you have not cleanly implemented yet is peripheral vision: a low-resolution global summary that is always available and cheap.

The key constraint you already observed empirically:

If “context” is fed into every expert’s predictor inputs, 
∣
𝑖
𝑛
𝑗
∣
∣in
j
	​

∣ rises 
⇒
𝐿
𝑗
∝
∣
𝑖
𝑛
𝑗
∣
∣
𝑜
𝑢
𝑡
𝑗
∣
⇒L
j
	​

∝∣in
j
	​

∣∣out
j
	​

∣ rises 
⇒
𝐿
𝑒

𝑓

eff
 rises 
⇒

⇒b

	​

 rises

∗
ℎ
𝑐
𝑜
𝑙
𝑙
𝑎
𝑝
𝑠
𝑒
𝑠
∗
∗
⇒∗∗hcollapses∗∗.

So the biologically-correct way is:

Compute a very low-dimensional peripheral summary 
𝑔
(
𝑡
)
g(t) (e.g., pooled 4×4 over the 16×16 field, per channel; or even just a handful of global moments).

Update a slow context register:

𝑧
(
𝑡
)
=
(
1
−
𝛽
𝑧
)
𝑧
(
𝑡
−
1
)
+
𝛽
𝑧
 
𝑔
(
𝑡
)
z(t)=(1−β
z
	​

)z(t−1)+β
z
	​

g(t)

Use 
𝑧
(
𝑡
)
z(t) only in salience / retrieval bias, not in prediction 
𝑊
𝑗
W
j
	​

:

𝑢
𝑗
←
𝑢
𝑗
+
𝛼
𝑐
𝑡
𝑥
 
sim
(
𝑧
(
𝑡
)
,
𝑧
𝑗
)
u
j
	​

←u
j
	​

+α
ctx
	​

sim(z(t),z
j
	​

)

where 
𝑧
𝑗
z
j
	​

 is a slow tag of when node 
𝑗
j tends to be useful.

This makes context do what hippocampal indexing does: select which memories matter, without charging every micro-predictor for extra input width.

Fix 3 — Swap “surprise-only” exploration for “surprise + uncertainty” (still within your substrate)

Greedy residual fails because “no observation” means “no error signal.” A second biologically-standard driver is uncertainty: you look where your belief is weak, not only where it is currently wrong.

You already maintain per-dimension variances 
Σ
𝑗
[
𝑘
]
Σ
j
	​

[k]. Define a block uncertainty (from fused precision or last-seen variance) and add:

score
(
𝑏
)
=
residual
(
𝑏
)
+
𝜆
cov
log
⁡
(
1
+
𝜏
block
(
𝑏
)
)
+
𝜆
𝜎
 
uncertainty
(
𝑏
)
score(b)=residual(b)+λ
cov
	​

log(1+τ
block
	​

(b))+λ
σ
	​

uncertainty(b)

This directly targets the “silent drift” regions before they explode.
